            EXECUTING THE PROGRAM

To execute this front-end sample JSON parsing
program you can either do so by executing these
files altogether from teh HTML document in your 
localhost or by launching it on my websites subdirectory
where I tested and pushed my code.

    (http://www.jblocktech.com/code-challenge)

------------------------------------------------

	What I used to Parse the JSON Data

I wrote the parser scripts in regular Vanilla Javscript as
reccomended in the prompt sent to me with the JSON file. 
Since we were allowed to be creative with the way we set up
the Front End, I didn't necessarily utilize all the data I 
parsed, but I did keep the existing parsing scripts availible in the
noted JS code kept within the file parsing-script.js

------------------------------------------------

	    Where SEO can be included

I left <meta> tags for metadata as well as
sections in the navbar which could lead to about
pages. This is where content writers could shine and
re iterate some of teh keywords and description used in the
meta tags to create a much higher SEO for the intended website.
I also reiterated the name of this fake website many times 
throughout the page including header sections which is 
important for SEO purposes.

-------------------------------------------------


	       UI & Frontend Design

For the design I mainly used <div> margins in html 
and used the javascript output statements to automate HTML 
to give the site a uniform look. I also used your photos
that I mined from the JSON document to help design the frontend.

-------------------------------------------------

		Testing the Frontend

I had used Google pagespeed insights to make sure that the page
loaded efficiently as well as parsed the JSON efficiently. After 
testing it multiple times and optimizing it as I could, it ended up getting
a great page speed review. The biggest optimization was making the photos
even smaller which increased the loading time exponentially. I changed it to a 
percentage rather than the 306px x 306px mined for the photos in the JSON document
and that made the page more aesthetic on mobile as well.

-------------------------------------------------
	
		Mobile Development

The page looks aesthetic and is very navigational on mobile devices
It is easy to read, easy to understand, and responsive to any
mobile device.
